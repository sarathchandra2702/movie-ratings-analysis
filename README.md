🎬 Comparative Analysis of Online Movie Ratings Across Platforms


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and compares movie ratings from major platforms including Fandango, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. Using data analytics and statistical exploration, the goal is to understand how ratings differ across platforms and identify patterns, inconsistencies, and possible score inflation.

The project demonstrates a full data analysis and data science workflow — from raw datasets to clean, visualized, and insight-driven conclusions.



📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on two real-world datasets:

fandango_scrape.csv – Movie ratings collected from Fandango

all_sites_scores.csv – Ratings from multiple platforms such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic

These datasets allow for direct comparison of movie scores across different rating systems.



🔍 What This Project Does

The notebook performs the following:

Loads and merges multiple movie rating datasets

Cleans and preprocesses the data

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizes rating distributions and differences

Compares how platforms score the same movies

Identifies patterns, correlations, and inconsistencies



📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is used to examine:

How ratings are distributed on each platform

Which platforms tend to rate higher or lower

Differences between critic and audience scores

Relationships between different rating sources

Graphs and statistical summaries help uncover how rating behavior varies across platforms.



📈 Key Insights

This project provides insights into:

How movie ratings differ between platforms

Which platforms show signs of rating inflation or deflation

How consistent movie scores are across sites

How users and critics evaluate films differently

These findings are useful for understanding media analytics, consumer behavior, and rating systems.
